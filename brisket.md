## Time

- Prep Time: 15 min
- Cook Time: 5 hours
- Inactive Time: ~8 hours
- Total Time: 13 hours 15 min

## Ingredients

### Brisket

- 5 lb brisket

### Marinade

- 1 cup ketchup
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 cup vinegar
- 1 cup BBQ sauce
- 1 package onion soup mix

(note: I usually make a double-batch of the marinade - it needs to completely cover the brisket)

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Put all of the marinade ingredients into a medium pot on high heat.
3. Stir until sugar is dissolved and the marinade is bubbling.
4. Put the brisket into an aluminum pan slightly larger than the brisket (try to find the right size pan)
5. Pour the marinade over the brisket - MAKE SURE IT COVERS THE WHOLE BRISKET
6. Cover it tightly with tin foil.
7. Bake for 4 hours.
8. Remove the pan from oven, uncover, and let cool.
9. Take the brisket out of the pan and slice it against the grain.
10. Place the brisket back into the pan, cover it tightly with tin foil, and put it in the fridge until the next day.
11. The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
12. Put the brisket back into to the oven (still covered) and bake for 1 more hour before eating.
