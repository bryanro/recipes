# Mayonaise

## Time

- Prep Time: 10 min
- Cook Time: 0 min
- Total Time: 10 min

Makes about 1 cup of mayo.

## Ingredients

- 1 large egg (room temperature)
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp red or white wine vinegar
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 1 cup (240 ml) neutral flavored oil, grapeseed, safflower or canola are best
- 1 tsp fresh lemon juice (optional)

## Steps

1. Add egg to the small bowl of a food processor and process for 20 seconds. Add the mustard, vinegar, and salt. Process for another 20 seconds.
2. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, turn the food processor on then begin to slowly add the oil in tiny drops until about a quarter of the oil has been added.
3. When you notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken and emulsify, you can be a little less strict. With the processor on, continue to add it slowly, but increase to a very thin stream instead of drops of oil.
4. When all of the oil has been added, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and process for an extra 10 seconds. Taste mayonnaise for seasoning then add salt, lemon juice or extra vinegar to taste. (Note, if the mayo seems too thin, slowly stream in more oil with the processor running until thick.)
