# Latkes

## Time

- Prep Time: 10 min
- Cook Time: 20 min
- Total Time: 30 min

## Ingredients

- 2-3 large russet potatoes
- 1 cup sweet or yellow onion
- 2 eggs
- salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 3 tbsp flour or almond flour
- vegetable oil (for frying)

_optional_
- sour cream
- applesauce

## Steps

Add onion, eggs, salt, pepper and flour. Mixture should be thick and cohesive.
Pour about 1/4 inch of oil into a heavy-bottomed frying pan. I use an electric frying pan at 375 so it doesn't get too hot and burn the latkes.
Use about 2 Tablespoons potato mixture and place in the oil and press into a patty.
Fry for about 3 minutes. Flip and fry for another 3 or so minutes. If pancake cooks too fast, reduce oil's temperature. If it takes longer, turn the oil up so they don't get soggy. Repeat with remaining potato mixture.
Drain on paper towels and serve immediately, or keep in a 250 oven on a baking sheet.

1. Shred the potatoes using a grater, then squeeze to get all of the excess water out.
2. Add onions, eggs, salt, pepper, and flour.
3. Pour oil into cast iron pan at medium / medium-high heat.
4. Scoop 2 tbsp of mixture to make each latke. Heat until cooked brown.
